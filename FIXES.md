# OLFIM System - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Infinite Loop in Search Functionality

**Problem**: The search functionality was causing an infinite loop due to a circular dependency between the search page component and the AppContext. The search page would call `searchItems` from AppContext, which would update the state, triggering another search.

**Solution**: 
- Added a `useRef` to track if the initial search has been performed
- Added a check to prevent searching if already in progress
- Only perform search if it's the initial render or if search parameters have changed

### 2. Navigation Issues

**Problem**: The RouterProvider component was using `window.location.href` for navigation instead of Next.js's router, causing full page reloads and breaking client-side navigation.

**Solution**:
- Updated RouterProvider to use Next.js's `router.push()` for client-side navigation
- Fixed login and signup pages to use router for redirects

### 3. State Management in AppContext

**Problem**: The AppContext was not properly managing state between the useItems hook and its own state, causing issues with item display.

**Solution**:
- Restructured AppContext to use the useItems hook without creating circular dependencies
- Used useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added proper error handling for TypeScript

### 4. Debugging and Monitoring

**Problem**: It was difficult to diagnose issues without proper debugging information.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive debugging to the search page
- Added debugging to the ItemList component
- Added debugging to the SearchBar component
- Created test scripts to verify functionality

## New Features

### 1. Test Scripts

- **test-app.js**: Verifies database connection and checks for users and items
- **test-search.js**: Tests search functionality with various queries

### 2. Improved Error Handling

- Added better error handling in AppContext
- Added TypeScript error handling with proper type annotations

## How to Test

1. Run the application with `npm run dev`
2. Test the database connection with `npm run test-app`
3. Test the search functionality with `npm run test-search`
4. Use the search page to search for items
5. Check the browser console for debugging information

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive error handling
2. Improve search algorithm with fuzzy matching
3. Add pagination for search results
4. Add more test coverage
