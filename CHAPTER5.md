# CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

## 5.1 Summary

The Online Lost and Found Resources Information Management System (OLFIM) for the University of Cross River State (UNICROSS) was developed to address the inefficiencies in the manual process of managing lost and found items within the university community. The system provides a digital platform that streamlines the reporting, tracking, and recovery of lost items.

The development of the OLFIM system followed a structured approach, beginning with requirements gathering and analysis, followed by system design, implementation, testing, and deployment. The system was built using modern web technologies, including Next.js for the frontend and backend, MongoDB for data storage, and React Context for state management.

Key features of the OLFIM system include:

1. **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality with role-based access control (user and admin roles).

2. **Item Reporting**: A user-friendly interface for reporting lost or found items, including details such as description, category, location, and optional image upload.

3. **Search Functionality**: Advanced search capabilities allowing users to find items based on keywords, type (lost or found), and category.

4. **Admin Dashboard**: A comprehensive dashboard for administrators to manage items, update their status, and monitor system activity.

5. **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly interface that ensures accessibility across various devices.

The system architecture follows a three-tier model, separating the presentation, application, and data layers for improved modularity and maintainability. The database design includes two main collections: Users and Items, with appropriate relationships and validation rules.
