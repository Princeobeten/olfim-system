# OLFIM System - Project Summary

## Overview
The OLFIM System is a Next.js application built as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a modern UI/UX. The project follows a modular structure for ease of navigation and scalability, with a focus on rapid development and maintainability.

## Implemented Features

### Authentication System
- **API Routes**: Created routes for signup, login, and retrieving the current user
- **User Model**: Implemented a Mongoose schema with password hashing and validation
- **Authentication Hook**: Created a custom `useAuth` hook for client-side authentication
- **Global State**: Set up `AppContext` for managing authentication state across the application
- **Protected Routes**: Implemented `AuthCheck` component to protect routes from unauthorized access

### UI Components
- **Login Page**: Form with email and password fields, error handling, and link to signup
- **Signup Page**: Form with name, email, password fields, validation, and link to login
- **Dashboard**: Protected page showing user information and logout functionality
- **Home Page**: Updated with links to login, signup, and dashboard

### Utility Functions
- **Validation**: Email validation, password strength checking, and form validation
- **Formatters**: Date formatting, text truncation, currency formatting, and text capitalization

### Testing
- Created a test script for authentication API routes

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications
- **MongoDB/Mongoose**: Database and ORM for data storage
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication
- **bcryptjs**: Password hashing library

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Access the application at: `http://localhost:3000`

## Next Steps
- Add more features based on specific requirements
- Enhance UI/UX with more components and interactions
- Implement additional API routes for business logic
- Add more comprehensive testing
- Deploy to a production environment
