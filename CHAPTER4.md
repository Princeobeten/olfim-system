```

**Figure 4.1: Three-Tier Architecture of the OLFIM System**

### 4.2.1 Presentation Tier

The presentation tier represents the user interface of the application. It is built using:

- **Next.js Pages & Components**: Provides the structure and routing for the application
- **React UI Components**: Reusable interface elements for consistent user experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern design

This tier is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It communicates with the application tier through API calls.

### 4.2.2 Application Tier

The application tier contains the business logic and processes user requests. It includes:

- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions that handle HTTP requests
- **Authentication Logic**: Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Business Logic**: Implements core functionality like item reporting, searching, and matching
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity before storage

This tier acts as a mediator between the presentation tier and the data tier, processing requests, applying business rules, and returning appropriate responses.

### 4.2.3 Data Tier

The data tier is responsible for data storage and retrieval. It consists of:

- **MongoDB Database**: A NoSQL database for storing application data
- **Mongoose ODM**: Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB and Node.js
- **Data Models**: Schemas defining the structure of the data

This tier ensures data persistence, integrity, and efficient retrieval.

## 4.4 Database Structure

The OLFIM system uses MongoDB, a NoSQL document database, to store application data. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and compatibility with JavaScript/Node.js applications. The database structure is designed to efficiently store and retrieve information about users and items.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER {
        string _id PK
        string name
        string email
        string password
        string role
        date createdAt
    }
    
    ITEM {
        string _id PK
        string type
        string description
        string category
        string location
        string image
        string status
        string userId FK
        boolean isAnonymous
        string contactInfo
        date createdAt
    }
    
    USER ||--o{ ITEM : reports
```

**Figure 4.2: Entity Relationship Diagram of the OLFIM Database**

The database consists of two main collections:

1. **Users Collection**: Stores information about system users
2. **Items Collection**: Stores information about lost and found items

The relationship between these collections is established through the `userId` field in the Items collection, which references the `_id` field in the Users collection. This allows the system to track which user reported each item.

## 4.5 Database Table Definition

### 4.5.1 Users Collection

The Users collection stores information about system users, including authentication credentials and role information.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +String _id
        +String name
        +String email
        +String password
        +String role
        +Date createdAt
        +matchPassword(enteredPassword)
    }
```

**Figure 4.3: User Schema Definition**

| Field | Type | Description | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| _id | ObjectId | Unique identifier for the user | Primary Key, Auto-generated |
| name | String | User's full name | Required, Max length: 50 |
| email | String | User's email address | Required, Unique, Valid email format |
| password | String | Hashed password | Required, Min length: 6, Not returned in queries |
| role | String | User's role in the system | Enum: ['user', 'admin'], Default: 'user' |

The User schema includes a method to compare entered passwords with the hashed password stored in the database:

```javascript
UserSchema.methods.matchPassword = async function(enteredPassword) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword, this.password);
};
```

Additionally, the schema includes a pre-save hook that automatically hashes passwords before saving them to the database:

```javascript
UserSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
  if (!this.isModified('password')) {
    next();
  }
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, salt);
});
```

### 4.5.2 Items Collection

The Items collection stores information about lost and found items reported by users.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Item {
        +String _id
        +String type
        +String description
        +String category
        +String location
        +String image
        +String status
        +ObjectId userId
        +Boolean isAnonymous
        +String contactInfo
